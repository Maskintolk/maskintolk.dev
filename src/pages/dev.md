# PREFERRED WORK

<br />

### After spending nearly 25 years working in the Danish IT industry, I have worked with my share of different tools and technologies.

<br />

### These days I am most enthusiastic about the following technologies (in order of interest):

<br />

## 1. FRONTEND

- [Lit](https://lit.dev/) (LitElement)
- Web components
- PWA

<br />

## 2. FLUTTER

- Apps (Android/iOS)
- Web
- Prototyping

<br />

## 3. NOTION

[Notion](https:/notion.so/) is something I use for many things in my personal life. I believe the potential of Notion is pretty much limitless

<br />

- Notion templates and workflows
- Notion API

<br />

<br />

## 4. C#, .NET

- [ASP.NET](http://asp.NET) MVC
- ASP.NET Core
- REST APIs
