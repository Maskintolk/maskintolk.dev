# My name is Jakob

<br />

## I am an inquisitive and pragmatic JavaScript/TypeScript web developer with a keen interest in Flutter, people and UX.

<br />

### I used to be a fullstack developer for many years. Being a little late to the party I fell completely in love with with components after participating in the [Polymer Developer Summit 2017](https://summit.polymer-project.org/schedule) in Copenhagen.

<br/>

### Frontend and the browser just seemed so much more interesting to me after that. But it wasn't so much the Polymer library that got me intrigued so much as the conference mantra <i>#UseThePlatform</i> which I found refreshing.
