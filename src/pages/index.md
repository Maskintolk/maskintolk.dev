# ABOUT ME

<br />

## I am an inquisitive and pragmatic JavaScript/TypeScript web developer with a keen interest in Flutter, people and UX.

<br />

### I used to be a fullstack developer for many years. Being a little late to the party I fell completely in love with with web components after participating in the [Polymer Developer Summit 2017](https://summit.polymer-project.org/schedule) in Copenhagen.

<br/>

### Frontend and the browser just seemed so much more interesting to me after that. But it wasn't so much the Polymer library that got me intrigued as it was the notion of finally having re-usable, self-contained, components on the web.

<br/>

### Another thing that appealed to me was the way that the Polymer folks repeatedly stated that their end goal was to eventually make Polymer superfluous hence the conference mantra <i>#UseThePlatform</i>.
